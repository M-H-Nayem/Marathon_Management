🌟 About the Project
This project is a robust Marathon Management System designed to streamline the experience for both marathon organizers and participants. It offers a seamless platform where event organizers can easily add and manage marathon events, while participants can effortlessly browse, apply for, and keep track of their chosen marathons.

Built with the powerful MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this application demonstrates my full-stack development capabilities. The frontend is crafted with React for dynamic user interfaces and styled beautifully with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design. Firebase is integrated to provide secure and efficient user authentication (Login/Logout), ensuring a smooth and protected user experience.

This system is a testament to my ability to develop scalable, user-centric web applications from concept to deployment.
